    "## LETTER OF MOTIVATION:\n",
    "\n",
    "        I am excited to apply for the Data Scientist position at Optiver. With three years of experience as a software developer at JP Morgan Chase and a year of options trading as a retail trader, I am eager to pursue my interest in technology and finance. Pursuing a master's degree in Financial Technology at Imperial College London has given me the opportunity to learn how to combine technology and finance in the most creative way possible.\n",
    "        My interest in financial markets has grown over time, and I have become increasingly interested in roles that offer exposure to the markets. After watching Optiver's C++ seminar on low-latency trading systems, I became intrigued by the company's work. I am aware that only the brightest minds in the industry work at Optiver, and I am eager to be part of this community to learn from them.\n",
    "        Knowing that Optiver is an innovation and tech-driven firm, as a potential data scientist, I want to apply my statistical and analytical skills to come up with creative solutions related to volatility prediction, asset pricing and alpha generation.\n",
    "        Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to work alongside some of the most talented and intelligent people in the business."

Since there is only one diagonal, where the food can lie. The ant can keep going downwards in the simulation and never reach the food. Making the answer **infinity**\n",
